<h1 align="center">:snake: SNAKE :snake:</h1>

# Description:

Snake is one of the most classical games, dating back to the arcade game Blockade, developed and published by [Gremlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlin_Industries) in 1976.
Being one of the most popular games in the history and one of the coolest, I have always wanted to create this game, and now I have the opportunity to do it as a project so I choosed to build it with an arduino and a 8x8 LED Matrix.

# :video_game: Game specification

So for this game I wanted to introduce some of the basic requirements game features like:
 * **Score**, varying from the dots eaten by snake ( + 1 for 0-9, +4 for 10-30, +6 for 30-60, +10 for 60-64)
 * **Speed**, growing the complexity of the game by increasing the speed when reaching certain levels (5, 10, multiple of 5)
 * **Levels** are determined by the growth of the snake/number of dots eaten
 * **More lives** will be added when a player reaches level 10, 20
 * **Stored highscore** into the EEPROM
 * **Animations** (in the beginning, when gaining life, when losing life, highscore, score, game over when the snake dies)
 * **MENU**: Start Game, Highscore (stored from EEPROM), Settings(Snake length between 3 and 8), INFO (with my name, github link, game name, unibuc robotics)
